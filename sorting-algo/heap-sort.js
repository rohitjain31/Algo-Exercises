// Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on binary Heap data structure.
// It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the
// maximum element at the end.

// Binary Heap???
// A Binary heap is a complete binary tree where items are sorted in a special order such that value
// in a parent node is greater or smaller than the values in its two children nodes.
// if value is greater than it is max heap and if value is smaller than it is min heap.
// The heap can be represented by binary tree and array.

// Complete Binary Tree???
// A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is
// completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

// Array based representation for binary heap??
// Array based representtion is space efficient. If the parent node is stored at index i, then
// the left child can be found at 2*i+1 and right child at 2*i+2.
